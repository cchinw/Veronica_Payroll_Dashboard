## VERONICA'S DASHBOARD

#### Veronica has a small business. She hires part-time workers to cover the front desk. She needs a

system to keep track of her workers (current and past), the number of hours they are scheduled to
work each week, and the weekly payroll report with taxes deducted and the net pay that each
employee is due. She needs an interface to enter employees and their scheduled hours for a week.

1. Create a database(s) to house the necessary data for this system
2. Populate data into the database(s)
3. Build front end UI / rest API client to interact with the system (e.g., add employees, modify
   employees, create &amp; modify a weekly schedule
4. Generate a payroll report that shows:

- employees
- if they are current or past
- hours worked by week
- associated pay, taxes, net salary for the week
